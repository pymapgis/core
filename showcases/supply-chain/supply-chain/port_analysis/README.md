```bash
cd examples/logistics/supply-chain/port_analysis
python port_congestion_analysis.py
```

## üìà Analysis Methodology

### Congestion Index Calculation
```python
congestion_index = weighted_average(
    berth_utilization * 0.3,
    storage_utilization * 0.2,
    processing_delays * 0.3,
    vessel_wait_times * 0.2
)
```

### Efficiency Score Formula
```python
efficiency_score = (
    (1 - congestion_index) * 0.4 +
    operational_efficiency * 0.3 +
    (1 - normalized_wait_time) * 0.3
)
```

### Cost Impact Assessment
- **Base Handling Cost**: $150 per TEU
