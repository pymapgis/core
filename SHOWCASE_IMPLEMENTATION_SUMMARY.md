- **🔥 Wildfire Risk Now** - Fire danger and population exposure (idea template ready)

Each idea includes:
- Complete implementation guide
- Data source documentation  
- Scoring formulas and color schemes
- Business value and use cases
- Technical requirements and success criteria

## 🛠️ Quality Standards Implemented

### Code Quality
- **Size Limits**: <200MB Docker images, <60 LOC core logic
- **Linting**: black, flake8, isort, pydocstyle requirements
- **Structure**: Required files, metadata headers, API endpoints
- **Documentation**: README, screenshots, data attribution

### API Requirements
- `GET /` - Interactive map viewer
- `GET /health` - Health check with JSON status
- `GET /public/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.mvt` - Vector tiles (public)
- `GET /internal/latest` - Full data (JWT protected)

### Validation Pipeline
- Automated file structure checks
- Code quality validation
- Docker build testing
- API endpoint verification
- Documentation completeness

## 🚀 Contributor Workflow

### 1. **Zero-Friction Onboarding**
```bash
# 5-minute test drive
git clone https://github.com/pymapgis/core.git
cd core/showcase-starter
docker compose up quake-demo
# Open http://localhost:8000 - live earthquake map!
```

### 2. **One-Command Scaffold Generation**
```bash
# Generate complete demo structure
python scripts/new_demo.py border-flow
# Creates showcases/border-flow/ with all files pre-configured
```

### 3. **Development & Testing**
```bash
# Build and test
make build DEMO=border-flow
make run-demo DEMO=border-flow
make validate DEMO=border-flow
```

### 4. **Quality Assurance**
```bash
# Automated validation
make lint                    # Code quality
make validate DEMO=demo-name # Requirements check
# CI will test: build, health check, image size
```

## 📊 Governance & Merge Policy Ready

### Issue Management
- **Labels**: `showcase`, `good first issue`, `stretch`, `help wanted`
- **Templates**: Structured issue creation with all required fields
- **Project Board**: Ready for "Backlog → In Progress → Review → Live" workflow

### Quality Gates
- ✅ One maintainer review required
- ✅ All CI checks must pass (build, lint, health check)
- ✅ <200MB Docker image size enforced
- ✅ Required API endpoints validated
- ✅ Documentation and screenshot required

### Auto-Publishing Ready
- Docker Hub matrix job template provided
- GitHub release tagging system (`showcase/<name>`)
- Docs site auto-catalog capability

## 🎨 Pre-Configured Demo Templates

The scaffold generator includes complete configurations for:

### **Border Flow** (Logistics)
- CBP Border Wait Times API
- Green→Red color scheme for wait times
- Truck/logistics themed icons and styling

### **Flight Delay** (Transportation)  
- FAA System Operations API
- Blue→Red color scheme for delay minutes
- Aviation themed icons and terminology

### **Wildfire Risk** (Emergency)
- NASA FIRMS fire data + Census population
- Green→Red risk assessment color scheme
- Emergency response themed styling

### **Custom Demos**
- Generic template with placeholder values
- Customizable for any domain or data source
- All required files generated automatically

## 🌟 Community Benefits

### For Contributors

## 🚀 Ready for Launch

The system is **immediately ready** for community use:

1. **Merge the `showcase-starter` branch** to main
2. **Create initial GitHub issues** from the demo ideas
3. **Set up project board** with the four columns
4. **Add repository badges** to README
5. **Announce to community** - blog post, social media, Discord

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

Based on the contributor funnel design:

### Short Term (1-3 months)
- 3-5 new showcase demos implemented
- 10-15 community contributors onboarded
- Complete Docker Hub showcase namespace

### Medium Term (3-6 months)
- 10+ showcase demos across multiple domains
- Monthly community blog posts featuring new demos
- Integration with main PyMapGIS documentation

### Long Term (6+ months)
- 20+ showcase demos covering major geospatial use cases
- Self-sustaining contributor community
- PyMapGIS recognized as the go-to tool for rapid geospatial prototyping

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Review and merge** the showcase-starter branch
2. **Test the workflow** by creating a few initial issues
3. **Set up automation** for Docker Hub publishing
4. **Community announcement** with clear call-to-action
5. **Monitor and iterate** based on contributor feedback
