# Supply Chain Risk Assessment

This example demonstrates comprehensive supply chain risk assessment using PyMapGIS for geographic risk analysis and supplier vulnerability evaluation.

## üìñ Backstory

**GlobalTech Manufacturing** is a multinational technology company sourcing components from suppliers across 12 countries. Recent global events (natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, cyber attacks) have exposed critical vulnerabilities in their supply chain.

The company needs to:
- **Assess risk exposure** across their global supplier network
- **Identify high-risk suppliers** and geographic concentrations  
- **Evaluate backup supplier capabilities** and redundancy gaps
- **Develop risk mitigation strategies** for supply disruptions
- **Create contingency plans** for business continuity

### Supply Chain Profile
- **12 suppliers** across 4 continents
- **$180M+ annual procurement** volume
- **6 supplier categories**: Electronics, Automotive, Machinery, Textiles, Materials, Services
- **Multiple risk exposures**: Natural disasters, political instability, cyber threats

## üéØ Risk Assessment Framework

### 1. Geographic Risk Analysis
- **Natural Disasters**: Earthquakes, typhoons, hurricanes, floods, wildfires
- **Political Instability**: Regional conflicts and governance risks
- **Infrastructure Risks**: Transportation and logistics disruptions
- **Cyber Security**: Location-independent digital threats

### 2. Operational Risk Factors
- **Financial Stability**: Supplier creditworthiness and financial health
- **Lead Time Risk**: Delivery time variability and dependencies
- **Backup Supplier Coverage**: Redundancy and alternative sourcing options
- **Quality Risk**: Product quality consistency and reliability
- **Volume Concentration**: Single-supplier dependency risks

### 3. Concentration Risk Analysis
- **Geographic Concentration**: Country and regional dependencies
- **Supplier Type Concentration**: Category-specific vulnerabilities
- **Single Supplier Dependencies**: Critical supplier identification

## üìä Data Description

### Suppliers Dataset (`data/suppliers.geojson`)
- **12 global suppliers** with detailed profiles
- **Geographic locations** with precise coordinates
- **Operational metrics**: Volume, lead times, quality ratings
- **Financial indicators**: Stability ratings and backup supplier counts
- **Supplier categories**: Electronics, automotive, machinery, textiles, materials, services

### Risk Zones Dataset (`data/risk_zones.geojson`)
- **8 major risk zones** covering global threat areas
- **Risk types**: Natural disasters, political, cyber, logistics
- **Severity levels**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- **Probability assessments**: Statistical likelihood of occurrence
- **Impact radius**: Geographic scope of potential disruption

## üöÄ Running the Analysis

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pymapgis geopandas pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### Execute the Assessment
```bash
cd examples/logistics/supply-chain/risk_assessment
python supply_chain_risk.py
```

### Expected Output
1. **Console Report**: Detailed risk analysis and actionable recommendations
2. **Visualization**: `supply_chain_risk_assessment.png` with 6 analytical charts:
   - Global supplier and risk zone map
   - Risk score distribution analysis
   - Country concentration assessment
   - Risk vs volume correlation
   - Supplier type risk breakdown
   - Risk category distribution

## üìà Risk Scoring Methodology

### Composite Risk Score Calculation
```
Composite Risk = (Geographic Risk √ó 0.4) + (Operational Risk √ó 0.6)
```

### Geographic Risk Components
- **Risk Zone Intersection**: Supplier location within identified risk areas
- **Severity Weighting**: Low (1), Medium (2), High (3)
- **Probability Adjustment**: Statistical likelihood of occurrence

### Operational Risk Components
```
Operational Risk = (Financial Risk √ó 0.25) + (Lead Time Risk √ó 0.20) + 
                  (Backup Risk √ó 0.25) + (Quality Risk √ó 0.15) + 
                  (Volume Risk √ó 0.15)
```

### Risk Categorization
- **Low Risk**: Score 0.0 - 0.3 (Green)
- **Medium Risk**: Score 0.3 - 0.6 (Yellow)  
- **High Risk**: Score 0.6 - 1.0 (Orange)
- **Critical Risk**: Score > 1.0 (Red)

## üéØ Expected Analysis Results

### High-Risk Suppliers Typically Include:
1. **Shenzhen Tech Components** (China)
   - High typhoon and earthquake exposure
   - Geopolitical risk factors
   - Limited backup suppliers

2. **Vietnam Textile Manufacturing**
   - Monsoon flood risk zone
   - Fair financial stability rating
   - Extended lead times

3. **Brazilian Raw Materials**
   - Political instability exposure
   - Single backup supplier
   - High volume concentration

### Concentration Risk Findings:
- **Asia-Pacific**: 60%+ of total procurement volume
- **Electronics**: 40%+ of supplier categories
- **Critical Dependencies**: 2-3 suppliers representing >15% each

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization Options

### Modify Risk Parameters
```python
# Adjust risk scoring weights
composite_risk = (geographic_risk * 0.5) + (operational_risk * 0.5)

# Change risk zone severity
severity_weights = {'low': 0.5, 'medium': 1.5, 'high': 2.5}

# Update concentration thresholds
critical_threshold = 0.20  # 20% volume concentration
```

### Add New Risk Factors
```python
# Environmental risks
environmental_risk = calculate_carbon_footprint_risk(supplier)

# Regulatory compliance risks  
compliance_risk = assess_regulatory_environment(supplier['country'])

# Currency fluctuation risks
currency_risk = evaluate_exchange_rate_volatility(supplier['country'])
```

### Enhanced Analysis
- **Network analysis**: Supply chain interdependency mapping
- **Scenario modeling**: Monte Carlo risk simulations
- **Real-time monitoring**: API integration for live risk feeds
- **Cost-benefit analysis**: Risk mitigation investment optimization

## üìã Business Impact & ROI

### Risk Mitigation Benefits
- **Supply disruption prevention**: 25-40% reduction in unplanned outages
- **Cost optimization**: 10-15% procurement cost savings through diversification
- **Compliance improvement**: Enhanced regulatory and ESG compliance
- **Competitive advantage**: Superior supply chain resilience vs competitors

### Implementation Recommendations
1. **Immediate Actions** (0-3 months)
   - Develop contingency plans for high-risk suppliers
   - Negotiate flexible contracts with backup suppliers
   - Implement risk monitoring dashboards

2. **Strategic Initiatives** (3-12 months)
   - Diversify supplier base across low-risk regions
   - Invest in supplier relationship management
   - Establish regional distribution centers

3. **Long-term Resilience** (1-3 years)
   - Build strategic supplier partnerships
   - Develop in-house manufacturing capabilities
   - Create industry risk-sharing consortiums

## üîÑ Next Steps

2. **Financial Modeling**: Quantify financial impact of identified risks
3. **Scenario Planning**: Model various disruption scenarios and responses
4. **Supplier Collaboration**: Share risk assessments with key suppliers
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Establish quarterly risk review processes
