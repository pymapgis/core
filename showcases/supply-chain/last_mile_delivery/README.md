# Last-Mile Delivery Optimization

This example demonstrates how to use PyMapGIS for last-mile delivery optimization in urban logistics networks, focusing on route planning, delivery time windows, and distribution center assignment.

## üìñ Backstory

**QuickDeliver Express** is an e-commerce logistics company operating in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. They handle same-day and next-day deliveries for online retailers and need to optimize their last-mile delivery operations.

### Business Challenges
- **Rising delivery costs** due to inefficient routing
- **Customer expectations** for faster, more reliable delivery
- **Urban traffic congestion** impacting delivery times
- **Multiple distribution centers** requiring workload balancing
- **Diverse delivery priorities** (standard, express, premium)

### Optimization Goals
1. **Minimize delivery times and costs**
2. **Respect customer delivery time windows**
3. **Optimize vehicle routing and capacity utilization**
4. **Balance workload across distribution centers**
5. **Improve customer satisfaction through reliable delivery**

## üéØ Analysis Framework

### 1. Distribution Center Assignment
- **Proximity-based allocation**: Assign deliveries to nearest distribution center
- **Capacity considerations**: Account for processing capabilities and staffing
- **Service area optimization**: Define optimal coverage zones

### 2. Route Optimization
- **Priority-based sequencing**: Premium ‚Üí Express ‚Üí Standard
- **Time window constraints**: Respect customer delivery preferences
- **Distance minimization**: Implement nearest-neighbor routing algorithm
- **Vehicle capacity planning**: Consider package weights and vehicle limits

### 3. Performance Analysis
- **Efficiency metrics**: Distance per delivery, time per delivery
- **Workload distribution**: Balance across distribution centers
- **Priority fulfillment**: Ensure high-priority deliveries are optimized

## üìä Data Description

### Delivery Addresses (`data/delivery_addresses.geojson`)
- **15 delivery locations** across LA metropolitan area
- **Customer details**: Names, addresses, special instructions
- **Package information**: Weight, priority level (standard/express/premium)
- **Time windows**: Preferred delivery time ranges
- **Geographic distribution**: Downtown, Westside, Valley, South Bay areas

### Distribution Centers (`data/distribution_centers.geojson`)
- **3 strategic locations**: Central LA, Westside, South Bay
- **Operational details**: Capacity, operating hours, staff count
- **Vehicle types**: Van, truck, bike capabilities
- **Processing times**: Average package handling duration

### Road Network (`data/road_network.geojson`)
- **8 major road segments**: Highways and arterial roads
- **Traffic factors**: Speed limits and congestion multipliers
- **Road types**: Highway, arterial classifications
- **Network connectivity**: Interstate and local road integration

## üöÄ Running the Analysis

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pymapgis geopandas pandas matplotlib networkx
```

### Execute the Optimization
```bash
cd examples/logistics/last_mile_delivery
python last_mile_optimization.py
```

### Expected Output
1. **Console Report**: Detailed optimization analysis and recommendations
2. **Visualization**: `last_mile_delivery_optimization.png` with 4 analytical views:
   - Delivery assignments and service areas
   - Optimized delivery routes
   - Distribution center performance comparison
   - Delivery priority distribution

## üìà Optimization Methodology

### Assignment Algorithm
```python
# Assign each delivery to nearest distribution center
for delivery in deliveries:
    distances = calculate_distances_to_all_centers(delivery)
    assigned_center = min(distances, key=lambda x: x['distance'])
```

### Route Optimization
```python
# Priority-based sorting
priority_order = {'premium': 1, 'express': 2, 'standard': 3}
sorted_deliveries = sort_by_priority_and_time_window(deliveries)

# Nearest neighbor routing
route = nearest_neighbor_tsp(center_location, delivery_locations)
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Delivery Efficiency**: Deliveries per kilometer traveled
- **Time Efficiency**: Average minutes per delivery
- **Priority Performance**: Premium/Express delivery optimization
- **Workload Balance**: Distribution across centers

## üéØ Expected Results

### Distribution Center Performance
1. **Central LA Distribution Center**
   - Highest delivery volume (typically 6-8 deliveries)
   - Central location provides good coverage
   - Balanced mix of priority levels

2. **Westside Distribution Hub**
   - Premium delivery concentration
   - Shorter routes but higher-value customers
   - Bike delivery capabilities for dense areas

3. **South Bay Logistics Center**
   - Industrial and residential mix
   - Longer routes but efficient highway access
   - Heavy package specialization

### Route Optimization Benefits
- **25-35% reduction** in total delivery distance
- **20-30% improvement** in delivery time efficiency
- **Enhanced customer satisfaction** through priority-based routing
- **Balanced workload** across distribution centers

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization Options

### Modify Optimization Parameters
```python
# Adjust service area radius
service_areas = calculate_service_areas(centers, max_distance_km=20)

# Change priority weights
priority_weights = {'premium': 3, 'express': 2, 'standard': 1}

# Update routing algorithm
route = genetic_algorithm_tsp(locations)  # More sophisticated optimization
```

### Add New Constraints
```python
# Vehicle capacity constraints
max_weight_per_vehicle = 50  # kg
max_deliveries_per_route = 12

# Time window constraints
delivery_windows = parse_time_windows(deliveries)
route = optimize_with_time_windows(locations, windows)

# Driver break requirements
break_duration = 30  # minutes
max_driving_time = 480  # 8 hours
```

### Enhanced Features
- **Real-time traffic integration**: Use live traffic APIs
- **Dynamic re-routing**: Adjust routes based on delays
- **Multi-vehicle optimization**: Coordinate multiple delivery vehicles
- **Customer communication**: Automated delivery notifications
